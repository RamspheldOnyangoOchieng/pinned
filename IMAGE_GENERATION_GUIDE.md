## üîß Technical Implementation

### How Images Are Loaded

1. **User enters Step 2, 3, or 4**
2. Component calls `loadCategoryImages()` function
3. Function checks if images are cached in `attributeImages` state
4. If not cached, fetches from `/api/attribute-images` endpoint
5. API checks database for cached generated image
6. If not in database, generates new image with Novita AI
7. Image URL returned and displayed in SelectionCard
8. User selection cached for character creation

### Caching Strategy

```
Level 1: Component State (Session)
  ‚Üì
Level 2: Database (attribute_images table)
  ‚Üì
Level 3: Supabase Storage (CDN delivery)
```

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE attribute_images (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  category TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'age', 'body', 'ethnicity'
  value TEXT NOT NULL,     -- '20s', 'Athletic', 'Asian', etc.
  style TEXT NOT NULL,     -- 'realistic' or 'anime'
  image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  seed INTEGER,
  width INTEGER,
  height INTEGER,
  prompt TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(category, value, style)
);
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After generation, verify:

### Database Check
```sql
-- Check total images generated
SELECT style, category, COUNT(*) 
FROM attribute_images 
GROUP BY style, category;

-- Should show:
-- realistic, age, 7
-- realistic, body, 7
-- realistic, ethnicity, 7
-- anime, age, 7
-- anime, body, 7
-- anime, ethnicity, 7
```

### Visual Check
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/create-character`
2. Select Realistic style (Step 0)
3. Proceed to Age selection (Step 2)
4. Verify: All 7 age images load
5. Select each age option - images should display
6. Repeat for Body Type (Step 3) and Ethnicity (Step 4)
7. Go back to Step 0, select Anime style
8. Verify anime images load for all categories

### API Check
```bash
# Check if images are accessible
curl http://localhost:3000/api/attribute-images?category=age&style=realistic

# Should return array of 7 images with URLs
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Images not generating

**Check Environment Variables:**
```bash
# In your .env.local file:
NOVITA_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

**Restart Dev Server:**
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
pnpm dev
```

### Issue: Images generate but don't appear

**Check Browser Console:**
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Look for network errors
- Check if API calls are successful

**Clear Cache:**
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
pnpm dev
```

### Issue: Some images fail to generate

**Regenerate Individual Images:**
1. Go to admin interface
2. Find failed image
3. Click regenerate button (‚Üª)

**Or use API:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/attribute-images \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "regenerate",
    "category": "age",
    "value": "20s",
    "style": "realistic"
  }'
```
