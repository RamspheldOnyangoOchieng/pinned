## To Generate Real AI Images

You have two options:

### Option 1: Use Novita AI (Recommended)
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/admin/generate-style-images`

This will:
1. Generate professional portraits for both styles
2. Upload to Supabase Storage
3. Update the image paths automatically

**Prompts Used:**
- **Realistic**: "Professional portrait photography of an elegant woman, photorealistic, studio lighting, fashionable outfit, upper body shot, beautiful features, natural makeup, friendly expression, 8k quality"
- **Anime**: "Beautiful anime girl character, manga style illustration, vibrant colors, detailed artwork, upper body portrait, elegant outfit, professional anime art style, studio quality"

### Option 2: Manual Upload
1. Find or create two images (800x1200px recommended)
2. Name them:
   - `realistic-style.jpg`
   - `anime-style.jpg`
3. Place in `/public/` folder
4. Refresh the page

## Current Behavior

When you visit `/create-character`:
1. ✅ Step 0 shows "Choose Style" heading
2. ✅ Two style cards display side by side
3. ✅ Gradient placeholder images show
4. ✅ Click any card to select it
5. ✅ Selected card gets pink border + checkmark
6. ✅ "Next" button becomes clickable
7. ✅ Click "Next" to proceed to Step 1 (Model Selection)

## Test It Now

1. Open: `http://localhost:3000/create-character`
2. You should see two cards side by side
3. Click "Realistic" - it should get a pink border
4. Click "Anime" - the selection should switch
5. Click "Next" - you should move to the next step

## Issues Fixed ✅

- ✅ Cards now display in a row (not column)
- ✅ Images created (gradients for now)
- ✅ Selection works (onClick handlers active)
- ✅ Next button works (canProceed returns true)
- ✅ Visual feedback clear and responsive

## Next Steps

If you want professional AI-generated images instead of gradients:

1. Navigate to: `/admin/generate-style-images`
2. Click "Generate Both Style Images"
3. Wait ~30 seconds per image
4. Images will auto-upload to Supabase
5. Refresh `/create-character` to see new images

**Cost**: ~$0.02 per image (2 images = $0.04 total)
