## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading
**Symptom:** Spinner keeps showing, image never appears

**Fix:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Test API directly: http://localhost:3000/api/attribute-images?category=age&value=20s&style=realistic
3. Should return: `{"success":true,"image_url":"https://..."}`

### Emojis Still Showing
**Symptom:** Emoji appears instead of image

**Fix:**
1. Check if image URL is actually returned
2. Verify SelectionCard component is using imageUrl prop
3. Check browser Network tab to see if image request is made

### Next Button Stuck
**Symptom:** Can't proceed to next step

**Fix:**
1. Check console for validation errors
2. Verify canProceed() function is checking correct state
3. Make sure a selection was actually made

### Database Connection Issues
**Symptom:** "Image not found" errors

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify database has images
PGPASSWORD="UWpeuVPyaX17Yarx" psql -h "aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com" -p 6543 -U "postgres.qfjptqdkthmejxpwbmvq" -d "postgres" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM attribute_images;"

# Should return: 198
```

---

## üìä Expected Results

### Database Query
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM attribute_images GROUP BY category;
```

**Should return:**
```
age         | 14

bust        | 12
ethnicity   | 14
eye_color   | 20

```

### API Test
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/attribute-images?category=hair_style&value=Straight&style=realistic"
```

**Should return:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "image_url": "https://qfjptqdkthmejxpwbmvq.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/attribute-images/hair_style-straight-realistic-*.jpg",
